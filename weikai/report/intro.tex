\section{Introduction}

In the scenario of end-to-end messaging,
a receiver may want to report to a trusted third party 
that the sender has sent abused message.
Note that the server typically needs to verify the report is authentic,
i.e., the sender indeed sent such message.
However, as the encryption is end-to-end,
the server could not know the message had the receiver not reported.
Message franking~\cite{grubbs_message_2017,fb_whitepaper} considers such scenario and proposes schemes
that realizes 1) the security of end-to-end authenticate encryption, and 
2) the feature of verifying an authentic report.
For the sake of exploration,
for each message, 
we say that the message is sent from Sender to Receiver 
in a \emph{sending phase},
where both Sender and Receiver are two clients;
then, in a \emph{reporting phase},
Receiver (w.r.t.~the message) may want to report to the trusted Server
that the message is abused.
