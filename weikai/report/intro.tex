\section{Introduction}

In the scenario of end-to-end messaging,
a receiver may want to report to a trusted third party 
that the sender has sent abused message.
Note that the server typically needs to verify the report is authentic,
i.e., the sender indeed sent such message.
However, as the encryption is end-to-end,
the server could not know the message had the receiver not reported.
Message franking~\cite{grubbs_message_2017,fb_whitepaper} considers such scenario and proposes schemes
that realizes 1) the security of end-to-end authenticate encryption, and 
2) the feature of verifying an authentic report.
For the sake of exploration,
for each message, 
we say that the message is sent from Sender to the receiver 
in a \emph{sending phase},
where both Sender and Receiver are two clients;
then, in a \emph{reporting phase},
Receiver (w.r.t.~the message) may want to report to the trusted Server
that the message is abused.

In this project, we implement message franking
in the open source library {\tt libsignal},
which is an open-source end-to-end encryption protocol.
The implemented message franking scheme is 
Committing Encrypt-then-PRF (CEP),
and we include the pseudocode in Figure~\ref{algo:cep}.

	\caption{Scheme of Committing Encrypt-then-PRF (CEP).
	In our implementation, 
	the encrypt/decrypt algorithm $(E,D)$ is AES-CTR;
	symmetric key $K$ and initial vector $N$ 
	are derived using HKDF from the shared secret
	of each message in {\tt libsignal};
	$H$ is the header of each message,
	which will be elaborated in Section~\ref{sec:version_verify};
	$M$ and $C$ are plaintext/ciphertext respectively.
