% \subsection{Conclusion}
To conclude,
in this work, we plug the message franking functionality to \texttt{libsignal} library
based on \yue{cite grubb's paper}.
We describe the high level idea and important details in our implementation,
and also give performance analysis. 
The time overhead and space overhead are both in an acceptable level \yue{change narratives},
indicating that we don't need to sacrifies too much performance to get the message franking scheme.
The issues emerging in our implementation are also discussed and
we propose our opinion on how to handle them.

For the next step,
we are planning to
